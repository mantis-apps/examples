# Mantis Todo Example

✨ **This Nx workspace has been generated by [Mantis, your passport to a seamless full-stack project launch.](https://github.com/futurizeworld/mantis-cli)** ✨

## Start the app

To start the development servers run `npx nx run-many --target=serve --projects=client,server`. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Happy coding!

## Testing

To run all of the unit tests, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=test`.

To run all of the unit tests with coverage, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=test --codeCoverage`. The coverage reports will be generated in the `coverage` folder at the root of this repo. You can view the reports in your browser by running `npx serve coverage/apps`.

To run all of the e2e tests, run `npx nx run server:serve` in one terminal window, then run `npx nx run-many --all --target=e2e`.

## Linting

To lint all projects, run `npx nx run-many --all --target=lint`.

## Generating code

This repo comes with some Nx plugins that can be leveraged to help you generate boilerplate.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```bash
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```bash
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).
